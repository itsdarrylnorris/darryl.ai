                <p>How everything started? A few weeks ago, I had run into some problems with my Ubuntu laptop and for this reason I had to re-install operating systems a few times. I had noticed that every time I install my Ubuntu Desktop I had to follow the same steps in order to have a developer‚Äôs environment. So I decided to create a shell script that will contain all the instructions and tools that I would need to have my workflow just in case I need it in the future.</p>
<p>Lazy Dubuntu is a faster, easier, flexible way to setup a Drupal development environment. This project currently only supported only Ubuntu Desktops. For more information please visit the project page. Last week, I posted LazyDubuntu, a project in the Drupal Group on LinkedIn, Google + Drupal Community, and Twitter, I had also received a lot of positive feedback back on it. Here is some interesting feedback that I had about the first week this project has been live.</p>
<p>First, I posted this project with the intention of getting some feedback because this project is not even close to be done. The discussion on the Drupal group in LinkedIn was basically about who this project is targeting too. Some users argue that this project should be targeting to a junior to intermediate developer that is looking for experience on setting up their development environment. Also, I got from other users different alternative such as Vagrant or Ansible. Vagrant is an amazing tool but is limited because it is only for virtual machines.</p>
<p>Five days after I posted this project, I receive an e-mail that Lazy Dubuntu was used on &ldquo;Intro Drupal Day&rdquo; a meet up on London. I was very surprised that other users started using it since this project is not completed. Thanks to those users that tried it out and found other bugs in the installation process.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs next? Some people have asked me what is going to be the next phase of Lazy Dubuntu. For the most part my main focus is going to be virtual host support because I believe that it is most important to have multiple development environments. Hopefully by mid-December Lazy Dubuntu will be supported in virtual host. However, I do not know what other problems I will be running into that I did not expect. Since this is an open source project hosted on Github anyone can provide feedback, open a new issue or even create a patch to contribute to this project. I will keep all the issues on the issue queue just in case you are wondering what I have been working on.</p>
