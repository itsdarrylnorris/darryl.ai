                <p>Hi Drupal World from sunny San Diego, I like to invite you to sprint with us and helping us on improve Drupal Console.</p>
<p>Our focus of this sprint is going to add some of the new features to Drupal Console, as using the a chain command as
actual command (<a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/issues/1898">#1898</a>) this will allow us to generate Drupal Console
commands without writing code. In addition, we will be working on improving the documentation about how we can use Drupal
Console in other contribute projects. Finally but no least, we are planing to try to separate the languages
(<a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/issues/1133">#1898</a>) from Drupal Console and creating independent projects for
each language. This will allow communities to start their own custom languages without need of committing into Drupal
Console core. However, anyone can contribute on any Drupal Console related issue that they want to improve or have fixed.</p>
<p>We did some previous attempts to sprint on Drupal Console at DrupalCon Bogota and DrupalCon Los Angeles, but this is the
first ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Drupal Console sprint. For this reason we have decide to re-organize our project to help new contributors.
We have added new labels (tags) to helps new users to understand the focus of each issue.</p>
<p>Here is the list of all new project labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Novice - For novice issue basic issues usually relate for new user contributing to the project.</li>
<li>Back-end - Issue related to module development.</li>
<li>Front-end - Issue relate to theme development.</li>
<li>Docs - Issues relate on adding and/or improving documentation about Drupal Console.</li>
<li>Translation - Issue relate with Translation.</li>
<li>Usability - Issues related on making Drupal Console more use-friendly.</li>
<li>Contrib-Support - Integration to track DC with other contrib projects.
As any sprint we need people to help us, we have decide to divide the types of ways to help base on the set-skills.</li>
</ul>
