                <p>For the past few months I have been playing around with few Drupal 8 projects, which they all are on working state and
they are been hosted at Drupal.org. However, I did not consider them all ready for productions meaning they was not
polished enough. Here you have three projects that now have a new release and what has changed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap_layouts">Bootstrap Layouts</a>: This project is a combination of Display Suite Bootstrap Layouts and Panels Bootstrap Layouts for
Drupal 8. I started this project back in November just for fun and never blog about it and suddenly the project got some
activity. Currently this project have over 91 installed and I got few people opening issues about the project. I had
this project on a dev release since November because there was some indentation minor bugs, missing templates and images.
This week I decide to do a major refactor on entire project structure. Also, thank for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/emptyvoid">@emptyvoid</a>, which provide all
the icons (images) for this project with a patch. Because all these changes I thought this project was stable enough as
result I created a stable release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/light_skeleton">Light Skeleton</a>: This is a theme that I ported to Drupal 8 back in December 2015 and to me it was pretty stable I did a
lot testing before releasing it to Drupal.org. Actually Light Skeleton it was ready since RC1 but I did not feel
comfortable on having a stable release until at least this project is been use for other people beside me. This past
weekend, I decide to added the some configuration to the project so the user can save some time on configuring the theme
and I created a stable release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/casper">Casper</a>: This a theme inspired by the default Ghost theme &ldquo;Casper&rdquo;. This is blog-like theme, responsive and very clean
cut. I have been working on building this theme for over a month for my personal website. However, I decide to create a
dev release to get feedback from other people. I have been using this theme on a production site for few weeks already
and so far there is not been any issues. Jesus Molivas (jmolivas.com) is been using Casper for like a month an half,
since Casper was a sandbox. This project might not be 100% production ready, since still under development.</p>
<p>Feel free to try it out those project and feedback is always appreciated.</p>
