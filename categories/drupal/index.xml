      <title>Get Your Libraries And Breakpoint Information From The UI</title>

      <description>Have you ever try to get data from your libraries and/or breakpoints in Drupal 8 ? Drupal 8 core does not provide a UI for this information. And sometimes is nice to have the ability to know your data from the UI. Instead of trying to hunt down all that information by searching many files. For this reason, I decide to write few modules that will allow you to get some of the libraries and breakpoint information from the UI.</description>

      <title>4 New CKEditor Plugins For Drupal 8</title>

      <description>About a month ago I was testing a pull request (#1999) for Drupal Console that will generate boilerplate code to integrate a button plugin from CKEditor to Drupal 8. So apparently the integration to integrate a CKEditor plugin for Drupal 8 is very simple thanks to the great CKEditor API in Drupal 8. While testing this pull request (#1999) I ended up with 4 plugins in my computer and I decide to share the code in Drupal.</description>

      <description>Few months back I release my first contrib theme Light Skeleton, which was base on the Skeleton v2 project. Now I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce Drupal 8 version of this new theme. While porting the Drupal 8 version of this theme, I decide to improve some of the missing features from the Drupal 7 version. These features include a modern lightweight menu and new regions to the theme.
New Menu Light Skeleton now have a very sexy lightweight menu, which is sticky on mobile and desktop.</description>

In this talk, we are going to be discussing the major differences between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 theming layers.</description>

      <description>Hi Drupal World from sunny San Diego, I like to invite you to sprint with us and helping us on improve Drupal Console.
Our focus of this sprint is going to add some of the new features to Drupal Console, as using the a chain command as actual command (#1898) this will allow us to generate Drupal Console commands without writing code. In addition, we will be working on improving the documentation about how we can use Drupal Console in other contribute projects.</description>

      <description>Have you ever try it out creating a views field template in Drupal 8? When I started working with Casper, I was trying to create a template base on a views field template and I notice few things inusual. First, there is no longer theming information from the views UI level instead they encourage you to use theme_debug (https://www.drupal.org/node/2362413). Sadly theme_debug does not show all the suggestion possible (https://www.drupal.org/node/2118743) and one of those suggestion is views field templates.</description>

      <description>For the past few months I have been playing around with few Drupal 8 projects, which they all are on working state and they are been hosted at Drupal.org. However, I did not consider them all ready for productions meaning they was not polished enough. Here you have three projects that now have a new release and what has changed.
Bootstrap Layouts: This project is a combination of Display Suite Bootstrap Layouts and Panels Bootstrap Layouts for Drupal 8.</description>

      <description>I have been working on website (un)official Pokemon fan website and as part of this project we need to create pages with Pokemon data. I found Pokéapi which is a Pokémon RESTful API. Pokéapi have all the data (and even more) that what I need in order to generate my nodes. So, I wrote a module that is going to take data from Pokéapi and generate into nodes. I decide to upload that module into Drupal.</description>

      <description>Light Skeleton is a theme base on version of Skeleton v2. The goal of this project is trying to be as close as Skeleton v2 in the Drupal theme.

Features  A new truly responsive grid based on percentages Mobile first media queries New typeface Raleway as default Generally simpler style More robust forms (especially in relation to grid) Inclusion of basic table styling Inclusion of super basic code styling Similar Projects  They are couple contrib themes based on Skeleton, however; none of them are based on the latest version of Skeleton.</description>

      <description>Drupal 8 is going to be a central place to store data and can easily connect with different third-party applications. Dries Buytaert has talked about this idea multiple times in DrupalCon Austin and DrupalCon Bogota, where Drupal 8 is going to be an API to connect to other places. For this reason, Drupal 8 is now integrated with web services in core. In other words, this is an easy way to export data into Hal-JSON, JSON, and XML.</description>

      <description>How can you replace the title field to a term of reference (taxonomies)? This is very tricky because the title field is been hardcore written on a content type (in Drupal 7) and by default it cannot be easily replace. In this article I would explain you how I was able to use a term of reference as my title. But first why use a term of reference instead of a title?</description>

      <description>As part of April Fools Pantheon is allowing you to destroy your Pantheon Dashboard as a game. You can destroy everything, settings, deploys, git connections and ssh connection. They called it the Pantheon Ride The Lighting. So now you have a way to mess up with your co-workers and tell them that you deleted all the Drupal commits. Here is how I destroy the dashboard of the https://www.darryl.ai website.
The game actually does not remove or destroy everything you can refresh your page and everything is going to be fine.</description>

      <title>CSS for Drupal 7 Site Builders</title>

      <description>When I started working on my first Drupal project adding css was a little bit tricky. At first I used to add css on the main style sheet from the theme. When most of the time this is not a good ideas because sometimes you do not want to override everything on the entire website. Sadly Drupal 7 by default does not allow you to add css from the administration pages.</description>

As part of the lazy project, we are providing two set of commands new-website and delete-website.</description>

      <description>Managing updates for multiple Drupal website it can consume a lot time. You might receive many e-mails from each Drupal website saying that you need to update your website. And sometimes you cannot update a specific module because you are using features that the next version it might cause a problem on your website. In order to see what updates your website needs you need to log in to each website to determinate, if a security update or even which updated it asking for.</description>

      <guid>https://www.darryl.ai/blog/lazy-dubuntu-first-week-recap/</guid>
      <description>How everything started? A few weeks ago, I had run into some problems with my Ubuntu laptop and for this reason I had to re-install operating systems a few times. I had noticed that every time I install my Ubuntu Desktop I had to follow the same steps in order to have a developer’s environment. So I decided to create a shell script that will contain all the instructions and tools that I would need to have my workflow just in case I need it in the future.</description>
