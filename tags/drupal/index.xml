      <description>About a month ago I was testing a pull request (#1999) for Drupal Console that will generate boilerplate code to integrate a button plugin from CKEditor to Drupal 8. So apparently the integration to integrate a CKEditor plugin for Drupal 8 is very simple thanks to the great CKEditor API in Drupal 8. While testing this pull request (#1999) I ended up with 4 plugins in my computer and I decide to share the code in Drupal.</description>

      <description>Have you ever try it out creating a views field template in Drupal 8? When I started working with Casper, I was trying to create a template base on a views field template and I notice few things inusual. First, there is no longer theming information from the views UI level instead they encourage you to use theme_debug (https://www.drupal.org/node/2362413). Sadly theme_debug does not show all the suggestion possible (https://www.drupal.org/node/2118743) and one of those suggestion is views field templates.</description>

      <description>When I started working on my first Drupal project adding css was a little bit tricky. At first I used to add css on the main style sheet from the theme. When most of the time this is not a good ideas because sometimes you do not want to override everything on the entire website. Sadly Drupal 7 by default does not allow you to add css from the administration pages.</description>

      <description>How everything started? A few weeks ago, I had run into some problems with my Ubuntu laptop and for this reason I had to re-install operating systems a few times. I had noticed that every time I install my Ubuntu Desktop I had to follow the same steps in order to have a developerâ€™s environment. So I decided to create a shell script that will contain all the instructions and tools that I would need to have my workflow just in case I need it in the future.</description>
