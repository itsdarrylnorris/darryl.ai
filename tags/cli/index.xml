      <description>Hi Drupal World from sunny San Diego, I like to invite you to sprint with us and helping us on improve Drupal Console.
Our focus of this sprint is going to add some of the new features to Drupal Console, as using the a chain command as actual command (#1898) this will allow us to generate Drupal Console commands without writing code. In addition, we will be working on improving the documentation about how we can use Drupal Console in other contribute projects.</description>
