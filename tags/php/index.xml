      <description>Have you ever try to get data from your libraries and/or breakpoints in Drupal 8 ? Drupal 8 core does not provide a UI for this information. And sometimes is nice to have the ability to know your data from the UI. Instead of trying to hunt down all that information by searching many files. For this reason, I decide to write few modules that will allow you to get some of the libraries and breakpoint information from the UI.</description>

      <description>Few months back I release my first contrib theme Light Skeleton, which was base on the Skeleton v2 project. Now I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce Drupal 8 version of this new theme. While porting the Drupal 8 version of this theme, I decide to improve some of the missing features from the Drupal 7 version. These features include a modern lightweight menu and new regions to the theme.
New Menu Light Skeleton now have a very sexy lightweight menu, which is sticky on mobile and desktop.</description>

In addition, we will be working on improving the documentation about how we can use Drupal Console in other contribute projects.</description>

Bootstrap Layouts: This project is a combination of Display Suite Bootstrap Layouts and Panels Bootstrap Layouts for Drupal 8.</description>

So, I wrote a module that is going to take data from Pokéapi and generate into nodes. I decide to upload that module into Drupal.</description>

      <description>Drupal 8 is going to be a central place to store data and can easily connect with different third-party applications. Dries Buytaert has talked about this idea multiple times in DrupalCon Austin and DrupalCon Bogota, where Drupal 8 is going to be an API to connect to other places. For this reason, Drupal 8 is now integrated with web services in core. In other words, this is an easy way to export data into Hal-JSON, JSON, and XML.</description>

      <description>How can you replace the title field to a term of reference (taxonomies)? This is very tricky because the title field is been hardcore written on a content type (in Drupal 7) and by default it cannot be easily replace. In this article I would explain you how I was able to use a term of reference as my title. But first why use a term of reference instead of a title?</description>

      <description>As part of April Fools Pantheon is allowing you to destroy your Pantheon Dashboard as a game. You can destroy everything, settings, deploys, git connections and ssh connection. They called it the Pantheon Ride The Lighting. So now you have a way to mess up with your co-workers and tell them that you deleted all the Drupal commits. Here is how I destroy the dashboard of the https://www.darrylnorris.com website.
The game actually does not remove or destroy everything you can refresh your page and everything is going to be fine.</description>
